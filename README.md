# Project: Image2Image + Text2Image Video Generation for FAU Engineering

## Description
This project uses AI models to turn images and text into short videos about FAU’s College of Engineering. It combines image-to-image and text-to-image generation methods using Stable Diffusion and AnimateDiff. The goal is to make creative videos that show FAU Engineering’s research, labs, and student life.

## Frameworks
- PyTorch  
- Diffusers  
- Transformers  
- OpenCV
  
## Goal
To generate short and realistic videos from either text or image input that represent FAU Engineering creatively.
