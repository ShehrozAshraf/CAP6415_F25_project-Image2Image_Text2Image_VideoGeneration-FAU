Progress This Week

- Implemented our first text-to-video generation pipeline using the Diffusers library.
- Experimented with Stable Diffusion text-to-image and generated coherent frame sequences using a loop-based prompt-conditioning approach.
- Tested multiple prompt styles related to FAU Engineering, including labs, drones, robotics, and campus engineering buildings.
- Implemented the initial frame-saving and video-construction pipeline using OpenCV.
- Generated frames were saved as sequential PNG images.
- Successfully combined the frames into short MP4 video clips at variable FPS values (12 FPS, 24 FPS) to analyze smoothness and temporal consistency.
- Began experimenting with AnimateDiff for motion-aware video synthesis.
- Tested pretrained motion modules from the internet and validated compatibility with our base diffusion model.
- Compared outputs from AnimateDiff vs. our manual frame-loop approach to understand motion quality differences.
- Expanded our internal dataset of FAU Engineering images.
- Captured more pictures around campus including the engineering building exterior, hallways, and lab equipment.
- Organized datasets into separate folders for text-to-video and image-to-video testing.

Plan for Next Week:
- Begin implementing the image-to-image → video pipeline, using FAU images as starting keyframes.
- Improve temporal consistency by experimenting with control parameters (CFG scale, number of inference steps, scheduler types).
- Integrate AnimateDiff more tightly into our workflow and test custom motion modules.
- Start writing preliminary results and documenting comparisons between text-to-video and image-to-video outputs.
- Continue refining video generation quality and expanding dataset if needed.
